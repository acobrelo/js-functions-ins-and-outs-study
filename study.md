It's kind of early to make any definitive assertions, especially when my level of grasping the material fluctuates wildly from hour to hour. However, I'm ending the day in a pretty secure place. I feel like I understand pretty much everything we've covered so far and that, like with any language, the more I use it, the more innate it'll become. Eventually I'll get to the point where I'm less dependent on examples and notes but I think a lot of that will come with implementing these concepts more and more. I don't feel totally lost at all, am pretty optimistic, and perhaps most importantly, if I feel a little lost, I'm not going to despair. Yesterday I felt slightly behind but today I feel like I'm doing pretty well. So. Fluctuations expected, struggling is okay, and I feel comfortable asking for help. My mind is working and engaged and I'm interested in the content and motivated to understand for my own gratification, not because it's expected of me alone.
